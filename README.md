This is a browser interface that categorizes the job applications into one of four categories; followup (applications that need followup emails sent), no action (applications that do not require any immediate action), offers (applications that have resulted in offers), and denials (applications that have resulted in denials). The followup and no action categories are color coded to separate applications that have led to an interview.

Job Applications can be edited added to the data.json file. These applications should follow the example provided. The example can be left in the file as it will be ignored by the interface. The date that the application was last updated should be in the format of MM/DD/YYYY. The DescriptionFile field of the job application entry is the file name of the .md file located in the "Job Application Markdowns" folder that contains the job description for the job, without the extension. For example, if the job description is located at "Job Application Markdowns/Example.md", the DescriptionFile field should be "Example".
